1.3.1 (2017-12-20)
------------------

- Improved readme
- Porting package to Windows 32 and 64. It can be compiled with Visual Studio.

1.3.0 (2017-12-05)
------------------

New tools / examples:

- Added tool gc_pointcloud that demonstrates synchroneous streaming and 3D
  reconstruction

Improvements of convenience layer:

- Accept true and false for boolean GenICam values additionally to 1 and 0
- Added option to ignore cache when reading parameter
- Added convenience function getColor()

- Changing request for timestamp in gc_stream tool
- Fixed finding devices by user defined name

Improvement of help texts and messages:

- Improved help for command line tools
- Improved exception description
- Added printing components with enabled status in gc_stream tool
- Removed output of user name in gc_info as this is not the name that can be
  defined via gc_config -n

Changes of access mode to permit parallel read access:

- Open device in gc_info readonly so that it can be used in parallel to an
  open device
- Open device in gc_config readonly if no parameter changes are requested
- Opening device in gc_stream with access mode control
- Changed getDevice() function so that exclusively opened devices are
  discovered as well

Configuration and optimization:

- [baumer] increase NextResendWaitPackets to 200
- add net_perf_check.sh script

Changes in build configuration:

- Ensure that the install directory lib/rc_genicam_api is accessible for
  everybody
- option to disable building of tools
- option for building shared libs
- generate version info
- add option to disable doc target
- Switched off vectorization and looking for CUDA as it is not necessary
- add Baumer GenTL lib for armv7l

1.2.0 (2017-08-15)
------------------

- rename rcgcapi to rc_genicam_api
- getDevice() now accepts specification if interface as prefix
- Added possibility to clean all resources before exit to avoid crashes of GenTL
- add all GenICam files/libs instead of depending on external package
- rename pfnc.h to pixel_formats.h
- bundle GenTL lib from Baumer as fallback if GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH is not set

1.1.5 (2017-05-11)
------------------

- Enforced using IPv4 format for setting persistent IPs and improved output of gc_config

1.1.4 (2017-04-13)
------------------
